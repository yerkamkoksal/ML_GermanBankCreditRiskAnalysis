# German Bank Credit Risk Analysis

## Overview
The "German Bank" project involves analyzing the German Credit (Statlog) Dataset, which contains data on 1,000 loan applicants. Each applicant is represented by 9 features, including age, sex, credit history, and job stability. The goal of the project is to predict the credit risk ('good credit' or 'bad credit') for new loan applicants based on these features.

## Key Features
- **Dataset Examination**: Utilizes the German Credit Dataset with 700 'good credit' and 300 'bad credit' instances.
- **Data Cleaning and Visualization**: Cleans the dataset to remove null values and visualizes various aspects of the data using plots.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Examines the correlation between different features.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Prepares the data for modeling by handling categorical and numerical data, splitting the data into training, validation, and test sets.
- **Model Training and Evaluation**: Implements a k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) classifier to predict credit risk and evaluates its performance.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Libraries: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn

## Installation and Execution
1. Clone the repository or download the `.ipynb` file.
2. Ensure Python 3.x is installed along with required libraries.
3. Run the Jupyter notebook (`GermanBank.ipynb`) in a Jupyter environment (like Jupyter Lab or Google Colab).

## Usage
- Execute the notebook cells sequentially to perform the analysis.
- The notebook contains detailed comments and instructions within each step.
